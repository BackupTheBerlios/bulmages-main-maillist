Tomi Ahonen, que era ejecutivo de Nokia y ahora se gana la vida como consultor 
de mercado de los móviles [<A HREF="http://communities-">http://communities-</A>
dominate.blogs.com/brands/2012/01/tomi-ahonen-and-this-blog-rated-top-power-
influencer-in-mobile-by-forbes.html] , en su blog comenta sobre los resultados 
hasta el momento (básicamente, que Android e iOS son los que más cuota de 
mercado de &quot;smartphones&quot; tienen) y las previsiones para este año 2012 
(básicamente, que lo más probable es que Android e iOS sigan en ello):

ANDROID

Android has reached the point where it is selling roughly half of all new 
smartphones worldwide. The rocket-ship like rise in its market share growth 
has slowed and now is only growing by smaller gains per quarter, as is likely 
when you approach the half-point of any industry with several rivals. Google 
has on paper a phenomenal army of its Android supporters - of the ten biggest 
smartphone makers, seven produce Android smartphones today and each of the 
last 3 in the Top 10 are supporting a different OS, meaning Android is now the 
giant big bad wolf, that faces three little pigs to face off against, so to 
speak. But that is the optimist's view. The glass-is-half-empty view says that 
Android's strongest partner, Samsung, is not fully committed and could easily 
move half of its total smartphone production to its other platforms in just 
one year; and several other Android rivals have stated a willingness to 
support other platforms including HTC to Windows Phone and Huawei to the now-
deceased MeeGo (and thus could go to Tizen). Android is not built on a solid 
foundation, but it was built very fast. Google is now adding many supporting 
elements, not the least of which is the various initiatives around Google 
Money.

Android's big growth obstacle in 2012 is that the rest of the field is mostly 
weeded out, the weaklings are gone and who remain tend to be stronger players 
with long-term interests. If we say Apple will do about 20% of the market in 
2012, and say Blackberry does 10%, and the Nokia-Microsoft mess of Symbian, 
Windows Phone, Windows Mobile and MeeGo - to have a combined about 10% this 
year, then we have blocked out 40% and if Android walks into 2012 with 50%, 
there is maybe 10% to fight for. And biggest in that ring is Samsung with 
bada/Tizen which took 2% last year - its first full year and twice what 
Microsoft's Windows Phone did in the same period, also its first full year, but 
Windows Phone had HTC, Samsung, Nokia and others selling its phones. bada did 
it alone with Samsung.

So the upside potential for Android is somewhere under 60% for 2012 and it 
could end that we see the ceiling at 50% if Samsung shifts strongly away from 
Android. The big Nokia give-away from Symbian has already happened so there is 
not much to take from there and the Palm give-away has already finished and the 
Windows Mobile market give-away has about 1% left to go. I think we are seeing 
this year a settling of the 'natural' state of Android into the 50% to 60% 
range where it is likely to be relatively stable for some years go come.

iOS

The second bestselling smartphone OS last year was Apple's iOS. Remember, I am 
only counting smartphones, so if you want the full iOS ecosystem, it is bigger 
when we add iPads and iPod Touch devices. But I only count smartphones for 
this market, as smartphone sales are drastically bigger than tablet PCs or 
media players etc. And the other platforms like Android have tablets too. I 
will analyze the full ecosystem battle later in this blog

Apple's iPhone has shown a stunning ability to reach past supposed ceilings of 
where its price would be a limit. Last year selling 93 million iPhones, Apple 
took 19% of the smartphone market but when we count all mobile phone handsets 
(1.6 Billion sold last year) that was only 6% of the global handset market, 
and that percentage is well in line with the historical market share of what 
the Macintosh PC has been doing over its 28 year history. Apple is an 
aspirational luxury brand, make no mistake about it. While in the premium 
phone 'smartphone' category Apple can near one in five smartphones sold, in all 
mobile phones, where the iPhone costs more than 10 times the average price of 
a mobile phone handset worldwide - it is simply too expensive. I have said for 
several years, that the iPhone cannot grow its market share in meaningful ways 
anymore. I have been proven wrong, but I say it again. If Apple only release 
one new superphone priced iPhone this year, they have a natural limit of what 
they can do with such an expensive device. If they grow, it will be in very 
slight increments, a percent or two. Far more likely - remember the Deloitte 
projection of four out of ten smartphones sold this year will cost under 100 
dollars (unsubsidised price) - the 660 dollar iPhone (unsubsidised price) will 
hit a market share ceiling due to being overpriced. As to an ecosystem, for 
developers of say smartphone apps and games, the iPhone installed base reaches 
one in six smartphones used worldwide. In installed base it is now third 
behind Symbian and Android, having overtaken the Blackberry installed base.

SYMBIAN

Nokia's Symbian started the year as the world's bestselling smartphone OS and 
had half a dozen significant smartphone manufacturers as its partners like 
Fujitsu, Sharp, Panasonic etc. After Stephen Elop created his communication 
disaster with the Elop Effect, Symbian sales crashed. Today it is the third 
bestselling smartphone OS and at Q4 of 2011 managed only 11% market share. It 
should be noted, that even 11 months after the infamous 'Burning Platforms' 
memo and more than a year of Windows Phone sales, Symbian alone on Nokia still 
outsold all Windows Phone smartphones made by HTC, Samsung, LG and yes, Nokia 
itself - by what? By 10 to 1. So don't think Symbian is going to go down 
quietly. Just looking at the spectacular 808 PureView and its monster camera 
technology, Symbian shows abilities that Windows Phone won't be able to 
replicate for at least another year. But yes, Elop did announce the death of 
Symbian and we see it now going.

This is very likely the swan song year for Symbian, we will probably see the 
very last Symbian based smartphone launched this year and then it will be 
over. Nokia never reached the 150 million more Symbian devices as promised by 
Elop. And this year we should see a strong ramp-down of the Symbian devices, 
with the intention of a 1 to 1 replacement by Nokia's Lumia line of Windows 
Phone based smartphones. Like I wrote in the above, the early evidence 
suggests that won't happen. But in any case, we should see Symbian's current 
11% market share dwindling down to about 2% or so by the Christmas quarter, 
when no new Symbian models are released and only older Symbian models are 
still being moved off the shelves, at severe discounts. It is sad, as still 
today, by installed base Symbian is the world's most used smartphone and even 
in Q4, was the bestselling smartphone OS on each of the three most populous, 
of the six inhabited continents. I feel like Symbian is being killed while it 
still had a lot to give, come on, just look at the 808 PureView for example or 
other recent Nokia flagships like the E7.

The only difference to this scenario is if Elop is fired and/or the Windows 
Phone 'only' strategy is abandoned. I have said long before Elop came to town 
that Symbian is not viable for the future of Nokia, it has to go, but that as 
Nokia migrates away from Symbian, Symbian is still very well suited to low 
cost smartphones, those under 100 dollar devices with low specs. Windows Phone 
is not viable in that segment (at least not yet). So if Nokia had a clear 
change of leadership and/or smartphone strategy, the Symbian OS might live on 
at the lower end (and arguably its partner OS, MeeGo at the high end).

BLACKBERRY

The Blackberry OS was the fourth bestselling smartphone OS last year and its 
market share is gradually eroding while the smartphone sales are modestly 
growing. As Blackberry is not licenced to other manufacturers and RIM itself 
has had horribly bad luck in trying to expand the platform to other devices 
(epic failure with its tablet PCs), the Blackberry OS is the weakest of the 
ones with big footprints. For the installed base, the Blackberry smartphone 
does still reach over 100 million devices potentially, but many of those are 
enterprise/business smartphones which have limits and restrictions how they 
can be used, so this potential is severely limited in reality, as a far 
smaller addressable market on the consumer side of Blackberry at perhaps half 
that number.

That was the big bad wolf and the three little pigs, Android, vs iPhone, 
Symbian and Blackberry. Then what else is in the forest? Some ants. Lets start 
with the biggest, the killer ant:

BADA

Samsung's bada is the fifth biggest smartphone OS by new sales and this year 
will become the fifth biggest by installed base, passing the size of the 
dwindling installed base of outgoing Windows Mobile. bada devices captured a 
2% market share in Q4 of last year and have grown steadily and outsold for 
example the Windows Phone OS across all its makers by more than 2 to 1, even 
after Nokia jumped into the Windows Phone market. bada is so far only a 
Samsung-supported OS, but it is said to be developed into the Tizen path, 
which has other handset makers also committed to it. We should see the first 
Tizen smartphones launched by Samsung during 2012 and we should learn more 
about the converging development paths of these two operating systems then. In 
any way, when Microsoft talks about 'Windows Phone is the Third Ecosystem' 
please note that it is not even the 5th ecosystem by any measures, bada is. 
Microsoft's operating systems come in at 6th and 7th today.

WINDOWS PHONE

Microsoft's Windows Phone is a year and a half old now, and after its launch 
quarter when it splashed onto the scene with Microsoft handing out millions of 
free devices, and the OS briefly held a 2% market share at launch, it fell ever 
since. By Q3 of 2011 the Windows Phone market share was nearing one half of 
one percent (yes, 0.5%) and only when Nokia's Lumia smartphones were launched 
with Nokia's biggest marketing push ever, did the Windows Phone sales recover, 
barely, to 1% market share in Q4 of 2011. Note that when you look at various 
industry analyst reports, they report now a 'Microsoft' market share in 
smartphones, which adds both Windows Phone and the incompatible older Windows 
Mobile OS. I do not fall for that trickery, the operating systems are 
incompatibile and should be counted separately. But Microsoft doesn't like 
that, as it highlights how badly Windows Phone is failing in the market.

And before we look at this year's potential, let me make one more point. 
Samsung, HTC, LG and others have been providing Microsoft based smartphones 
for years. They should know how to do it well. Samsung and LG are the 
bestselling dumbphone brands in the USA, Microsoft's best market, so they 
should be able to really do well in the US market with Microsoft powered 
smartphones. Both are doing well in smartphones in the USA, using Android. And 
HTC is one of the USA's bestselling smartphone brands, again on both Android 
and the various Microsoft platforms. If you want a 'dream team' of handset 
makers to support your Windows Phone platform in Microsoft's strongest market, 
the USA, then the group of Samsung, LG and HTC is it (not Nokia, which has 
failed in the US market recently). How was this trio doing in the USA? Saw 
failing Windows Phone sales all year. How did they do worldwide? Without 
counting Nokia Lumia smartphones, Windows Phone smartphones saw falling 
smartphone unit in four consecutive quarters! This while the industry grew 63% 
last year! Please do not delude yourself into thinking that the Windows Phone 
'ecosystem' with Samsung, HTC and LG joining Nokia is strong. The Windows 
Phone OS would have died last year, were it not for the last minute savior 
seen in Nokia. And in its first quarter of sales, the poorly performing Lumia 
series for Nokia became the bestselling Windows Phone brand in the world. 
Nokia did not need Microsoft to survive; it was the other way: Microsoft 
desperately needed Nokia to survive.

So what of this year? Yes. First, its pretty clear, come what may, Windows 
Phone will see growth. Not just unit growth, but market share gains. Its not 
much to shout about if you start from under 1% but at least its something. I 
said earlier that the shift was supposed to be about 1 to 1 as Nokia ramps 
down Symbian and replaces it with Lumia. If so, Nokia could have shifted about 
12% market share at the start of the year, 90% Symbian and 10% Windows Phone 
to about the same market share but opposite proportion by Q4, ie 90% Windows 
Phone and 10% remaining Symbian (I am obviously not including MeeGo in this 
simplified model). Now we know from the facts, that this will not happen. Nokia 
will still bleed sales as it tries to force undesirable Lumia smartphones to 
its loyal customers.  Lets say that by Q4 the total combined market is half, 
so 6% and 5% of that is Windows Phone and 1% is remaining Symbian. If so, 
Windows Phone on Nokia brand could get something like 4% of the global 
smartphone market this year - about 30 million smartphone handsets - and if we 
add another 2% by the other handset makers - which would still be more than 
doubling their current sales - and say Windows Phone has a total 2012 annual 
market share across all Windows Phone family smartphone manufacturers of 6%, 
that is about 45 million devices for the year. Pretty pathetic actually. But 
that is the kind of levels we should aim for for Windows Phone (remember, for 
Nokia there will be more smartphone sales from the ramping down of Symbian and 
what few millions of N9 and other MeeGo devices are perhaps sold as well).

MEEGO

For the full year MeeGo did not even register in the one percent range, but 
MeeGo only launched in the last quarter of 2011 with only one handset model 
actually sold, the N9 (even as its sister model, the N950 with QWERTY slider 
was also manufactured by Nokia in small numbers). Nokia refused to give the 
exact count of MeeGo powered N9 sales but in every country it did launch, it 
had very warm reviews, some actually calling it better than the iPhone! We 
calculated from Nokia's Q4 results that after we remove the Symbian sales and 
the Windows Phone sales, MeeGo sold about 1.75 million units worldwide in the 
few countries it launched in Q4. In the same period, the two Lumia smartphones 
sold at lower prices in more affluent countries that were Nokia's strongest 
markets - and flopped, selling only 600,000 units. So one MeeGo device, the N9, 
outsold both Lumia smartphones by 3 to 1, even as Nokia's CEO refuses to give 
the N9 and MeeGo any marketing support. This is a still-born OS that is likely 
to die quietly in 2012. The sad truth is, that if Nokia bothered to launch the 
N9 in those markets where the Lumia is now failing, and only sold at the same 
level - so Nokia would do about 3.5 million N9 unit sales in total - as its a 
very high priced smartphone, made in Nokia's own factories to Nokia standard 
components (the Lumia is not made in Nokia factories and does not use Nokia 
standard componets) and while the Lumia incurs a royalty payment to Microsoft, 
MeeGo based smartphones incur no royalty payments - Nokia would generate so 
much profit just from N9 sales globally, that Nokia corporation would return to 
profitability. But Elop feels his ego is more important than the profits of his 
company. So like I said, I expect MeeGo to be killed and buried this year. 
What a rotten end to a true winner that actually beat Microsoft when launched 
on the identical Nokia smartphone brand and on touch screen phones of near 
identical appearance. Also what a powerful last vindication of the MeeGo 
development team.

(Please note, Nokia seems to have 2 new MeeGo devices under development as 
reported on 28 March at the Netbook News site. This gives considerable lease-
of-life to MeeGo and if these devices come to the market during 2012, would be 
strong boost for Nokia. Also, this news to me even more strongly underlines 
the necessity for Nokia now to market the N9 and N950 globally in every 
market, while they are hot and desirable, since Nokia is clearly continuing 
also with MeeGo. Why on earth, when a CEO has a hit product on his hands, he 
would refuse to sell it, especially if this product could turn the loss-making 
smartphone unit into profit-generating once again)

WINDOWS MOBILE

Microsoft's Windows Mobile still refuses to die. It is used in some 
business/enterprise markets, sold in very small numbers by Samsung, HTC and 
others, in numbers of far less than 1 million in total last year. Microsoft is 
now terminating the app store for WinMo etc, but stubbnornly this thorn in 
Microsoft's side continues to sell in small numbers.

TIZEN

And then we have the Intel-Samsung partnershp with Tizen. While most of 
Tizen's steps have happened below the radar, there is vast potential for this 
OS to become the real 'third ecosystem.' Consider who are on the Tizen Board: 
Samsung and Intel, obviously, but also Japanese smartphone makers Panasonic, 
NEC and Casio. And then there is that 'tiny' player Huawei from China. Yes, 
that Huawei which has already passed LG and Motorola in smartphone sales per 
quarter, and is now chasing Sony and HTC. This is not an idle partnership. But 
wait, then there are the carriers! What? Yes, NTT DoCoMo, Orange, Telefonica 
and Vodafone are also on the Tizen Board. Just how big is that? These four 
carrier/operator groups control one sixth of the global mobile market from the 
telecoms subscriber side, and with 960 million subscribers, are a massive 
force in the industry. They include 3 of the 6 biggest operator/carrier groups 
globally. If they end up saying they will specify Tizen as their preferred OS 
- like NTT DoCoMo had done with Symbian in the past - its a near guarantee of 
Tizen commercial success. Understand, these four together are more than nine 
times as big as AT&amp;T of the USA for example.

The keys are when do we see first handsets, will there be serious commitment 
from the other handset makers, not just Samsung, and how will Samsung itself 
migrate and grow the bada evolution to Tizen. But this may well end up being 
the masterstroke by Samsung, snatching MeeGo/Intel partnership from Nokia and 
turning it into the legitimate 3rd ecosystem while Windows Phone lingers in 
6th or 7th place..
