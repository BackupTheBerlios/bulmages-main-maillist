<PRE>Interesante escrito, habrá que leerlo a fondo.

</I>&gt;<i> Tomi Ahonen, que era ejecutivo de Nokia y ahora se gana la vida como consultor
</I>&gt;<i> de mercado de los móviles [<A HREF="http://communities-">http://communities-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> dominate.blogs.com/brands/2012/01/tomi-ahonen-and-this-blog-rated-top-power-
</I>&gt;<i> influencer-in-mobile-by-forbes.html] , en su blog comenta sobre los resultados
</I>&gt;<i> hasta el momento (básicamente, que Android e iOS son los que más cuota de
</I>&gt;<i> mercado de &quot;smartphones&quot; tienen) y las previsiones para este año 2012
</I>&gt;<i> (básicamente, que lo más probable es que Android e iOS sigan en ello):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ANDROID
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Android has reached the point where it is selling roughly half of all new
</I>&gt;<i> smartphones worldwide. The rocket-ship like rise in its market share growth
</I>&gt;<i> has slowed and now is only growing by smaller gains per quarter, as is likely
</I>&gt;<i> when you approach the half-point of any industry with several rivals. Google
</I>&gt;<i> has on paper a phenomenal army of its Android supporters - of the ten biggest
</I>&gt;<i> smartphone makers, seven produce Android smartphones today and each of the
</I>&gt;<i> last 3 in the Top 10 are supporting a different OS, meaning Android is now the
</I>&gt;<i> giant big bad wolf, that faces three little pigs to face off against, so to
</I>&gt;<i> speak. But that is the optimist's view. The glass-is-half-empty view says that
</I>&gt;<i> Android's strongest partner, Samsung, is not fully committed and could easily
</I>&gt;<i> move half of its total smartphone production to its other platforms in just
</I>&gt;<i> one year; and several other Android rivals have stated a willingness to
</I>&gt;<i> support other platforms including HTC to Windows Phone and Huawei to the now-
</I>&gt;<i> deceased MeeGo (and thus could go to Tizen). Android is not built on a solid
</I>&gt;<i> foundation, but it was built very fast. Google is now adding many supporting
</I>&gt;<i> elements, not the least of which is the various initiatives around Google
</I>&gt;<i> Money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Android's big growth obstacle in 2012 is that the rest of the field is mostly
</I>&gt;<i> weeded out, the weaklings are gone and who remain tend to be stronger players
</I>&gt;<i> with long-term interests. If we say Apple will do about 20% of the market in
</I>&gt;<i> 2012, and say Blackberry does 10%, and the Nokia-Microsoft mess of Symbian,
</I>&gt;<i> Windows Phone, Windows Mobile and MeeGo - to have a combined about 10% this
</I>&gt;<i> year, then we have blocked out 40% and if Android walks into 2012 with 50%,
</I>&gt;<i> there is maybe 10% to fight for. And biggest in that ring is Samsung with
</I>&gt;<i> bada/Tizen which took 2% last year - its first full year and twice what
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's Windows Phone did in the same period, also its first full year, but
</I>&gt;<i> Windows Phone had HTC, Samsung, Nokia and others selling its phones. bada did
</I>&gt;<i> it alone with Samsung.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the upside potential for Android is somewhere under 60% for 2012 and it
</I>&gt;<i> could end that we see the ceiling at 50% if Samsung shifts strongly away from
</I>&gt;<i> Android. The big Nokia give-away from Symbian has already happened so there is
</I>&gt;<i> not much to take from there and the Palm give-away has already finished and the
</I>&gt;<i> Windows Mobile market give-away has about 1% left to go. I think we are seeing
</I>&gt;<i> this year a settling of the 'natural' state of Android into the 50% to 60%
</I>&gt;<i> range where it is likely to be relatively stable for some years go come.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> iOS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second bestselling smartphone OS last year was Apple's iOS. Remember, I am
</I>&gt;<i> only counting smartphones, so if you want the full iOS ecosystem, it is bigger
</I>&gt;<i> when we add iPads and iPod Touch devices. But I only count smartphones for
</I>&gt;<i> this market, as smartphone sales are drastically bigger than tablet PCs or
</I>&gt;<i> media players etc. And the other platforms like Android have tablets too. I
</I>&gt;<i> will analyze the full ecosystem battle later in this blog
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apple's iPhone has shown a stunning ability to reach past supposed ceilings of
</I>&gt;<i> where its price would be a limit. Last year selling 93 million iPhones, Apple
</I>&gt;<i> took 19% of the smartphone market but when we count all mobile phone handsets
</I>&gt;<i> (1.6 Billion sold last year) that was only 6% of the global handset market,
</I>&gt;<i> and that percentage is well in line with the historical market share of what
</I>&gt;<i> the Macintosh PC has been doing over its 28 year history. Apple is an
</I>&gt;<i> aspirational luxury brand, make no mistake about it. While in the premium
</I>&gt;<i> phone 'smartphone' category Apple can near one in five smartphones sold, in all
</I>&gt;<i> mobile phones, where the iPhone costs more than 10 times the average price of
</I>&gt;<i> a mobile phone handset worldwide - it is simply too expensive. I have said for
</I>&gt;<i> several years, that the iPhone cannot grow its market share in meaningful ways
</I>&gt;<i> anymore. I have been proven wrong, but I say it again. If Apple only release
</I>&gt;<i> one new superphone priced iPhone this year, they have a natural limit of what
</I>&gt;<i> they can do with such an expensive device. If they grow, it will be in very
</I>&gt;<i> slight increments, a percent or two. Far more likely - remember the Deloitte
</I>&gt;<i> projection of four out of ten smartphones sold this year will cost under 100
</I>&gt;<i> dollars (unsubsidised price) - the 660 dollar iPhone (unsubsidised price) will
</I>&gt;<i> hit a market share ceiling due to being overpriced. As to an ecosystem, for
</I>&gt;<i> developers of say smartphone apps and games, the iPhone installed base reaches
</I>&gt;<i> one in six smartphones used worldwide. In installed base it is now third
</I>&gt;<i> behind Symbian and Android, having overtaken the Blackberry installed base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SYMBIAN
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nokia's Symbian started the year as the world's bestselling smartphone OS and
</I>&gt;<i> had half a dozen significant smartphone manufacturers as its partners like
</I>&gt;<i> Fujitsu, Sharp, Panasonic etc. After Stephen Elop created his communication
</I>&gt;<i> disaster with the Elop Effect, Symbian sales crashed. Today it is the third
</I>&gt;<i> bestselling smartphone OS and at Q4 of 2011 managed only 11% market share. It
</I>&gt;<i> should be noted, that even 11 months after the infamous 'Burning Platforms'
</I>&gt;<i> memo and more than a year of Windows Phone sales, Symbian alone on Nokia still
</I>&gt;<i> outsold all Windows Phone smartphones made by HTC, Samsung, LG and yes, Nokia
</I>&gt;<i> itself - by what? By 10 to 1. So don't think Symbian is going to go down
</I>&gt;<i> quietly. Just looking at the spectacular 808 PureView and its monster camera
</I>&gt;<i> technology, Symbian shows abilities that Windows Phone won't be able to
</I>&gt;<i> replicate for at least another year. But yes, Elop did announce the death of
</I>&gt;<i> Symbian and we see it now going.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is very likely the swan song year for Symbian, we will probably see the
</I>&gt;<i> very last Symbian based smartphone launched this year and then it will be
</I>&gt;<i> over. Nokia never reached the 150 million more Symbian devices as promised by
</I>&gt;<i> Elop. And this year we should see a strong ramp-down of the Symbian devices,
</I>&gt;<i> with the intention of a 1 to 1 replacement by Nokia's Lumia line of Windows
</I>&gt;<i> Phone based smartphones. Like I wrote in the above, the early evidence
</I>&gt;<i> suggests that won't happen. But in any case, we should see Symbian's current
</I>&gt;<i> 11% market share dwindling down to about 2% or so by the Christmas quarter,
</I>&gt;<i> when no new Symbian models are released and only older Symbian models are
</I>&gt;<i> still being moved off the shelves, at severe discounts. It is sad, as still
</I>&gt;<i> today, by installed base Symbian is the world's most used smartphone and even
</I>&gt;<i> in Q4, was the bestselling smartphone OS on each of the three most populous,
</I>&gt;<i> of the six inhabited continents. I feel like Symbian is being killed while it
</I>&gt;<i> still had a lot to give, come on, just look at the 808 PureView for example or
</I>&gt;<i> other recent Nokia flagships like the E7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only difference to this scenario is if Elop is fired and/or the Windows
</I>&gt;<i> Phone 'only' strategy is abandoned. I have said long before Elop came to town
</I>&gt;<i> that Symbian is not viable for the future of Nokia, it has to go, but that as
</I>&gt;<i> Nokia migrates away from Symbian, Symbian is still very well suited to low
</I>&gt;<i> cost smartphones, those under 100 dollar devices with low specs. Windows Phone
</I>&gt;<i> is not viable in that segment (at least not yet). So if Nokia had a clear
</I>&gt;<i> change of leadership and/or smartphone strategy, the Symbian OS might live on
</I>&gt;<i> at the lower end (and arguably its partner OS, MeeGo at the high end).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BLACKBERRY
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Blackberry OS was the fourth bestselling smartphone OS last year and its
</I>&gt;<i> market share is gradually eroding while the smartphone sales are modestly
</I>&gt;<i> growing. As Blackberry is not licenced to other manufacturers and RIM itself
</I>&gt;<i> has had horribly bad luck in trying to expand the platform to other devices
</I>&gt;<i> (epic failure with its tablet PCs), the Blackberry OS is the weakest of the
</I>&gt;<i> ones with big footprints. For the installed base, the Blackberry smartphone
</I>&gt;<i> does still reach over 100 million devices potentially, but many of those are
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise/business smartphones which have limits and restrictions how they
</I>&gt;<i> can be used, so this potential is severely limited in reality, as a far
</I>&gt;<i> smaller addressable market on the consumer side of Blackberry at perhaps half
</I>&gt;<i> that number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was the big bad wolf and the three little pigs, Android, vs iPhone,
</I>&gt;<i> Symbian and Blackberry. Then what else is in the forest? Some ants. Lets start
</I>&gt;<i> with the biggest, the killer ant:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BADA
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Samsung's bada is the fifth biggest smartphone OS by new sales and this year
</I>&gt;<i> will become the fifth biggest by installed base, passing the size of the
</I>&gt;<i> dwindling installed base of outgoing Windows Mobile. bada devices captured a
</I>&gt;<i> 2% market share in Q4 of last year and have grown steadily and outsold for
</I>&gt;<i> example the Windows Phone OS across all its makers by more than 2 to 1, even
</I>&gt;<i> after Nokia jumped into the Windows Phone market. bada is so far only a
</I>&gt;<i> Samsung-supported OS, but it is said to be developed into the Tizen path,
</I>&gt;<i> which has other handset makers also committed to it. We should see the first
</I>&gt;<i> Tizen smartphones launched by Samsung during 2012 and we should learn more
</I>&gt;<i> about the converging development paths of these two operating systems then. In
</I>&gt;<i> any way, when Microsoft talks about 'Windows Phone is the Third Ecosystem'
</I>&gt;<i> please note that it is not even the 5th ecosystem by any measures, bada is.
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's operating systems come in at 6th and 7th today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WINDOWS PHONE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's Windows Phone is a year and a half old now, and after its launch
</I>&gt;<i> quarter when it splashed onto the scene with Microsoft handing out millions of
</I>&gt;<i> free devices, and the OS briefly held a 2% market share at launch, it fell ever
</I>&gt;<i> since. By Q3 of 2011 the Windows Phone market share was nearing one half of
</I>&gt;<i> one percent (yes, 0.5%) and only when Nokia's Lumia smartphones were launched
</I>&gt;<i> with Nokia's biggest marketing push ever, did the Windows Phone sales recover,
</I>&gt;<i> barely, to 1% market share in Q4 of 2011. Note that when you look at various
</I>&gt;<i> industry analyst reports, they report now a 'Microsoft' market share in
</I>&gt;<i> smartphones, which adds both Windows Phone and the incompatible older Windows
</I>&gt;<i> Mobile OS. I do not fall for that trickery, the operating systems are
</I>&gt;<i> incompatibile and should be counted separately. But Microsoft doesn't like
</I>&gt;<i> that, as it highlights how badly Windows Phone is failing in the market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And before we look at this year's potential, let me make one more point.
</I>&gt;<i> Samsung, HTC, LG and others have been providing Microsoft based smartphones
</I>&gt;<i> for years. They should know how to do it well. Samsung and LG are the
</I>&gt;<i> bestselling dumbphone brands in the USA, Microsoft's best market, so they
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to really do well in the US market with Microsoft powered
</I>&gt;<i> smartphones. Both are doing well in smartphones in the USA, using Android. And
</I>&gt;<i> HTC is one of the USA's bestselling smartphone brands, again on both Android
</I>&gt;<i> and the various Microsoft platforms. If you want a 'dream team' of handset
</I>&gt;<i> makers to support your Windows Phone platform in Microsoft's strongest market,
</I>&gt;<i> the USA, then the group of Samsung, LG and HTC is it (not Nokia, which has
</I>&gt;<i> failed in the US market recently). How was this trio doing in the USA? Saw
</I>&gt;<i> failing Windows Phone sales all year. How did they do worldwide? Without
</I>&gt;<i> counting Nokia Lumia smartphones, Windows Phone smartphones saw falling
</I>&gt;<i> smartphone unit in four consecutive quarters! This while the industry grew 63%
</I>&gt;<i> last year! Please do not delude yourself into thinking that the Windows Phone
</I>&gt;<i> 'ecosystem' with Samsung, HTC and LG joining Nokia is strong. The Windows
</I>&gt;<i> Phone OS would have died last year, were it not for the last minute savior
</I>&gt;<i> seen in Nokia. And in its first quarter of sales, the poorly performing Lumia
</I>&gt;<i> series for Nokia became the bestselling Windows Phone brand in the world.
</I>&gt;<i> Nokia did not need Microsoft to survive; it was the other way: Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> desperately needed Nokia to survive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what of this year? Yes. First, its pretty clear, come what may, Windows
</I>&gt;<i> Phone will see growth. Not just unit growth, but market share gains. Its not
</I>&gt;<i> much to shout about if you start from under 1% but at least its something. I
</I>&gt;<i> said earlier that the shift was supposed to be about 1 to 1 as Nokia ramps
</I>&gt;<i> down Symbian and replaces it with Lumia. If so, Nokia could have shifted about
</I>&gt;<i> 12% market share at the start of the year, 90% Symbian and 10% Windows Phone
</I>&gt;<i> to about the same market share but opposite proportion by Q4, ie 90% Windows
</I>&gt;<i> Phone and 10% remaining Symbian (I am obviously not including MeeGo in this
</I>&gt;<i> simplified model). Now we know from the facts, that this will not happen. Nokia
</I>&gt;<i> will still bleed sales as it tries to force undesirable Lumia smartphones to
</I>&gt;<i> its loyal customers.  Lets say that by Q4 the total combined market is half,
</I>&gt;<i> so 6% and 5% of that is Windows Phone and 1% is remaining Symbian. If so,
</I>&gt;<i> Windows Phone on Nokia brand could get something like 4% of the global
</I>&gt;<i> smartphone market this year - about 30 million smartphone handsets - and if we
</I>&gt;<i> add another 2% by the other handset makers - which would still be more than
</I>&gt;<i> doubling their current sales - and say Windows Phone has a total 2012 annual
</I>&gt;<i> market share across all Windows Phone family smartphone manufacturers of 6%,
</I>&gt;<i> that is about 45 million devices for the year. Pretty pathetic actually. But
</I>&gt;<i> that is the kind of levels we should aim for for Windows Phone (remember, for
</I>&gt;<i> Nokia there will be more smartphone sales from the ramping down of Symbian and
</I>&gt;<i> what few millions of N9 and other MeeGo devices are perhaps sold as well).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MEEGO
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the full year MeeGo did not even register in the one percent range, but
</I>&gt;<i> MeeGo only launched in the last quarter of 2011 with only one handset model
</I>&gt;<i> actually sold, the N9 (even as its sister model, the N950 with QWERTY slider
</I>&gt;<i> was also manufactured by Nokia in small numbers). Nokia refused to give the
</I>&gt;<i> exact count of MeeGo powered N9 sales but in every country it did launch, it
</I>&gt;<i> had very warm reviews, some actually calling it better than the iPhone! We
</I>&gt;<i> calculated from Nokia's Q4 results that after we remove the Symbian sales and
</I>&gt;<i> the Windows Phone sales, MeeGo sold about 1.75 million units worldwide in the
</I>&gt;<i> few countries it launched in Q4. In the same period, the two Lumia smartphones
</I>&gt;<i> sold at lower prices in more affluent countries that were Nokia's strongest
</I>&gt;<i> markets - and flopped, selling only 600,000 units. So one MeeGo device, the N9,
</I>&gt;<i> outsold both Lumia smartphones by 3 to 1, even as Nokia's CEO refuses to give
</I>&gt;<i> the N9 and MeeGo any marketing support. This is a still-born OS that is likely
</I>&gt;<i> to die quietly in 2012. The sad truth is, that if Nokia bothered to launch the
</I>&gt;<i> N9 in those markets where the Lumia is now failing, and only sold at the same
</I>&gt;<i> level - so Nokia would do about 3.5 million N9 unit sales in total - as its a
</I>&gt;<i> very high priced smartphone, made in Nokia's own factories to Nokia standard
</I>&gt;<i> components (the Lumia is not made in Nokia factories and does not use Nokia
</I>&gt;<i> standard componets) and while the Lumia incurs a royalty payment to Microsoft,
</I>&gt;<i> MeeGo based smartphones incur no royalty payments - Nokia would generate so
</I>&gt;<i> much profit just from N9 sales globally, that Nokia corporation would return to
</I>&gt;<i> profitability. But Elop feels his ego is more important than the profits of his
</I>&gt;<i> company. So like I said, I expect MeeGo to be killed and buried this year.
</I>&gt;<i> What a rotten end to a true winner that actually beat Microsoft when launched
</I>&gt;<i> on the identical Nokia smartphone brand and on touch screen phones of near
</I>&gt;<i> identical appearance. Also what a powerful last vindication of the MeeGo
</I>&gt;<i> development team.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Please note, Nokia seems to have 2 new MeeGo devices under development as
</I>&gt;<i> reported on 28 March at the Netbook News site. This gives considerable lease-
</I>&gt;<i> of-life to MeeGo and if these devices come to the market during 2012, would be
</I>&gt;<i> strong boost for Nokia. Also, this news to me even more strongly underlines
</I>&gt;<i> the necessity for Nokia now to market the N9 and N950 globally in every
</I>&gt;<i> market, while they are hot and desirable, since Nokia is clearly continuing
</I>&gt;<i> also with MeeGo. Why on earth, when a CEO has a hit product on his hands, he
</I>&gt;<i> would refuse to sell it, especially if this product could turn the loss-making
</I>&gt;<i> smartphone unit into profit-generating once again)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WINDOWS MOBILE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's Windows Mobile still refuses to die. It is used in some
</I>&gt;<i> business/enterprise markets, sold in very small numbers by Samsung, HTC and
</I>&gt;<i> others, in numbers of far less than 1 million in total last year. Microsoft is
</I>&gt;<i> now terminating the app store for WinMo etc, but stubbnornly this thorn in
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's side continues to sell in small numbers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TIZEN
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then we have the Intel-Samsung partnershp with Tizen. While most of
</I>&gt;<i> Tizen's steps have happened below the radar, there is vast potential for this
</I>&gt;<i> OS to become the real 'third ecosystem.' Consider who are on the Tizen Board:
</I>&gt;<i> Samsung and Intel, obviously, but also Japanese smartphone makers Panasonic,
</I>&gt;<i> NEC and Casio. And then there is that 'tiny' player Huawei from China. Yes,
</I>&gt;<i> that Huawei which has already passed LG and Motorola in smartphone sales per
</I>&gt;<i> quarter, and is now chasing Sony and HTC. This is not an idle partnership. But
</I>&gt;<i> wait, then there are the carriers! What? Yes, NTT DoCoMo, Orange, Telefonica
</I>&gt;<i> and Vodafone are also on the Tizen Board. Just how big is that? These four
</I>&gt;<i> carrier/operator groups control one sixth of the global mobile market from the
</I>&gt;<i> telecoms subscriber side, and with 960 million subscribers, are a massive
</I>&gt;<i> force in the industry. They include 3 of the 6 biggest operator/carrier groups
</I>&gt;<i> globally. If they end up saying they will specify Tizen as their preferred OS
</I>&gt;<i> - like NTT DoCoMo had done with Symbian in the past - its a near guarantee of
</I>&gt;<i> Tizen commercial success. Understand, these four together are more than nine
</I>&gt;<i> times as big as AT&amp;T of the USA for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The keys are when do we see first handsets, will there be serious commitment
</I>&gt;<i> from the other handset makers, not just Samsung, and how will Samsung itself
</I>&gt;<i> migrate and grow the bada evolution to Tizen. But this may well end up being
</I>&gt;<i> the masterstroke by Samsung, snatching MeeGo/Intel partnership from Nokia and
</I>&gt;<i> turning it into the legitimate 3rd ecosystem while Windows Phone lingers in
</I>&gt;<i> 6th or 7th place..
